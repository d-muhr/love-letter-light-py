# love-letter-light-py
 My current version of the card game "Love Letter" written in Python (version 3.10.4). 
 
 
 The "FYI: ..."-print statements  exist for (exploratory) manual testing purposes.
 I used these statements systematically to make sure that the program 
 works the way it should.


LESSONS LEARNED
- If I started this project again, I would have started as early as 
possible with a testing framework (e.g. 'unittest') in order to avoid
manual exploratory testing with the print-statements in the code.
